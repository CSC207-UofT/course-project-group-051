### Instructions:

- Our Program is similar to tinder and works similar in most ways.
- From the **login screen** you can choose to either **register** or **login**.
  - If you choose to **register**:
    - You will be brought to a **registration screen** that
      asks you to fill in all your information and will raise errors if you enter
      incorrect input. (Such as: a word for an age or leaving anything empty).
    - If you correctly enter input, you will be logged in as that user.
  - If you choose to **log in**:
    - First you will need to fill in the username and password fields, and then click the _log in button_.
    - If you did not fill in the fields, or you entered incorrect information
      you will receive an error.


- Once you are logged in however, you will be shown the **Swiping** screen.
  - In that screen you can choose _yes_ or _no_ on whether you "like" each user
    that you are shown. The users that you are shown are only users that match your gender preference, and you haven't
    said _yes_ to before.
  - A user that you are shown consists of their first name, age and bio, as well as  a
    profile picture in the middle of the screen.
  - Clicking _yes_ on a user records it in our database such that if they also lke you, you will
    both appear in each other's **Matches** page.
  - Clicking _no_ however, will record nothing and just move you to the next user, this also
    means that you can see the same user again if you constantly click _no_ on a person.
  - Once you run out of users to "swipe" on you will be shown a _refresh button_
    which will refresh the list of people you can swipe on. This is useful if
    another user creates their account while you are swiping (which could happen if we created
    an online database).
  - Additionally, the _refresh button_ will also show you users that you previously said _no_ to.


- On the swiping page there are also 3 buttons along the top: _Profile_, _Logout_, and _Matches_.
  - The _Logout button_ will bring you back to the **Login page**.
  - The _Profile_ button will bring you to the **My Profile page**:
    - In that page you can choose to change all of your data saved on your account.
    - This includes name, gender, image, etc.
    - It will also give you an error message if you put invalid input.
    - From there you can choose to go _Back_ which will return you to the **Swiping page**.
  - The _Matches button_ will bring you a page where you can see all the people you matched with.
    - From there you can click on any of them, and it will bring you to  a screen where
      you can message them.
    - Type a message and click _Send_, and you will see it appear on the screen
      in blue.
    - If you were to log in to the other person's account then you could see
      your message in green instead when you open up your messages.
    - If you click _back_ from the messages screen you will go back to your matches,
      and from there you can click _Back_ again, and it will take you back to **Swiping**.
