## Replace this README.md!

This is a standard README.md file for you to replace. You'll want to include your own content here!

MD (Markdown) files use [Markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): 
these look very much like .txt files, so you can write them in a very similar way.

1. Clone the project through VCS from Intellij.
2. Run the Session.java and Test.java to see our progress.
