## Replace this README.md!

This is a standard README.md file for you to replace. You'll want to include your own content here!

MD (Markdown) files use [Markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): 
these look very much like .txt files, so you can write them in a very similar way.

1. Create a new Intellij project(JavaFX option). Select JDK 1.8x. Give the project a name.
2. Download ALL files from the src/sample folder and paste them to the Src/Sample directory of the project. Delete the original "Controller" and "Main" class.
3. Run the main/UserTest class.
