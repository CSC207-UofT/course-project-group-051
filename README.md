- Our Program is similar to tinder and works similar in most ways.
- From the login screen you can choose to either register or login.
  - If you choose to register:
    - You will be brought to a registration screen that
    asks you to fill in all your information and will raise errors if you enter
    incorrect input. (Such as: a word for an age or leaving anything empty).
    - If you correctly enter input, you will be logged in as that user.
  - If you choose to log in:
    - First you will need to fill in the username and password fields, and then click the log in button.
    - If you did not fill in the fields, or you entered incorrect information
    you will receive an error.
- Once you are logged in however, you will be shown the "Swiping" screen.
- In that screen you can choose "yes" or "no" whether you like each user
that you are shown.
- A user that you are shown consists of their first name, age and bio, as well as  a
profile picture in the middle of the screen.
  
=======
1. Create an empty project on Intellij.
2. Copy all files from the src/Phase0 directory and move them to the project(this is due to Github's refactorization of directories).
3. Run the Session.java and Test.java to see our progress.
