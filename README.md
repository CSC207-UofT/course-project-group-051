## Replace this README.md!

This is a standard README.md file for you to replace. You'll want to include your own content here!

MD (Markdown) files use [Markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): 
these look very much like .txt files, so you can write them in a very similar way.

1. Create an empty project on Intellij.
2. Copy all files from the src/demo2 directory and move them to the project(this is due to Github's refactorization of directories).
