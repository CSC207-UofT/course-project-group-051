# Specifications
Our app will be implemented on a high-level basis, such that its use acts as a demonstration for a more developed version; meaning the interface will only utilize the current user’s use of the app.

* Running the app will initialize a finite set of possible matches allowing the user to interact with each possible match
  * Match: 2 users that have swiped right on one another

* The app will allow users to access a list of matches, a chat function (interacting only with list of matches), and the main ‘swiping’ aspect of the app

* The user can activate a left (no) and right (yes) action while swiping
    * Swiping: act of interacting with the interface to send a profile  left or right (yes or no)

* The app will detect when 2 users match and notify both users

* Users can add/change specific information on their profile

* The app promotes interactive behaviour between 2 users using notifications
