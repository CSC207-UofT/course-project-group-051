# Walk-Through
1. The user creates a new profile
2. The user inputs their personal information and preferences in a possible match
   1. The user cannot access other functions without completing their profile
3. The user then accesses a list via the interface to swipe on a list of those with matching preferences
4. They can then swipe left and right (yes or no) to define who they like
    1. Swiping right on a profile saves that profile to a list of the current users likes
5. When the user leaves the card view of swiping and switches to the list of matches view the program immediately checks
   for matches.
6. When the user chooses a match to chat with, the interface displays the chat view.
7. The user can then switch back to card view to see an updated list of possible matches.
