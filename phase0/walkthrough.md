# Walk-Through
1. The user can log in with a Username and a Password based on a previously saved user in our system.
2. They can then view details about their profile, such as their username, password, gender...
3. From the profile area they can also edit those details.
4. From the profile area the user can choose to swipe through other users who match their preferences or open up the messenger.
5. Going to the swiping page allows the user to swipe (left/right) on other users. If 2 users swipe right on eachother, they will be notified that there has been a match.
6. Going to the messenger page allows the user to view previous messages with matches or start a new message thread with a new match.
7. From these screens they can switch back to either of the 2 other screens.
